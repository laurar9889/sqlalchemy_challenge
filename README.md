Module 10 challenge

In this repository you will find 2 firectories and 2 files: one named "Resources" with the data provided for this challenge, and the second one called "SurfsUp" which has the same files that are outside of the directories. When reviewing the assignment before submition for the last time, I realized that the working files should had been included in the SurfsUp directory, so I wanted to correct that and present it as required. However, I realized that all my commits had been done on the files that I have outside the directory, and I did not want to lose the history of those files, so instead of removing them, I left them where they are. You can access them as you like (going to the Directory, or going to the file directly), as they are identical. (sorry about that)

Files:

"climate_starter" This file has Part 1 of the challenge; Analize and explore the climate data in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
"app.py" This file has Part 2 of the challenge; design a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1.

Notes:
Each command line is commented with relevant information for you to follow the logic behind it.
I received tutoring session to clarify Part 2 of the assignment. I was having some difficulties getting to run on a debugger mode. The assistant also further explained the expectations on the start, start and end date requirement (number 5 on my "py" file), as it was a bit confusing for me.
